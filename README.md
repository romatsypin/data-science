## Data Science Assignments
This repository contains two assignments which I have completed over my Data Science course at HAMK.<br>
The first assignment implements a K-nearest neighbours for the binary classification of whether Tweets of a certain Game Designer are written by himself or if he retweeted them for someone else.<br>
The second assignment implements a K-means clusterization algorithm to aggregate used cars by their attributes.<br>
